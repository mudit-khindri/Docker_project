# Docker_project
This is the Docker project for submission as a process of evaluation.
This project was made during the online training of docker under initiative IIEC RISE and 
LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd. The project is made using the topics taught to us during the online lectures and with my passion to learn because of which I was active on internet to learn and understand the concepts. 

I am very thankful to such a great initative.
